# HTML Images

## Learning Goals

- Recognize the `img` tag
- Use `img` tag attributes
- Create images

## Introduction

Images are absolutely critical to making appealing and engaging websites. Can
you imagine the web without them? No cat memes. No animated dancing bananas! No
_Instagram_, at all. The internet would be a pretty boring and sad place!

In this lesson, we will be discussing how to include images in your HTML, along
with some important attributes of the tag. With images, you can make your web
pages much more engaging and visually appealing.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this lesson into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio
Code. Finally, run `bundle` to install the lab's dependencies.

## Recognize the `img` Tag

Images are inserted into HTML using the `img` tag. The tag can display a variety
of image types, including animated GIFs, bitmaps and vector graphics, though
most often, the images we see on the internet are JPEG and PNG files.

The `img` tag is _self closing_, meaning it doesn't wrap around content or text.
Instead, the relevant information is stored in attributes within the tag itself.

There are two main attributes, `src`, the _source_ of the image, and `alt`, the
_alternate_ text.

## Use the `img` Tag Attributes

### The Image Source Attribute

The `src` attribute provides the relative path or URL to the image file we want
to display. The image file can be local, say, for instance, if you're publishing
a website and have a local stored in a folder, your source may look like this:

```html
<img src="../images/my_company_logo.png" />
```

However, its very common, even when publishing your own websites, to have images
hosted somewhere else on the internet. In these situations, we need to provide a
full URL as the source:

```html
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H1qsYEl.png" />
```

The `src` attribute is always necessary, as without it, the `img` tag would have
nothing to display.

### The Image Alt Attribute

The `alt` attribute contains text relevant to the image we're displaying, and
will appear in its place if the image fails to load.

While it isn't required, it is **highly recommended** that every image includes
an `alt` attribute. The `alt` text is important for screen readers for the
visually impaired, as the text will be read out loud to the site visitor. It is
also nice to provide some sort of message to a website visitor if the image
fails to load, especially if the image is relevant to the rest of the content.
Alt text on a failed image will appear along with a small 'broken image' icon:

To include an `alt` attribute, add it in along with the `src` attribute:

```html
<img
  src="https://i.imgur.com/H1qsYEl.png"
  alt="comedic crow gets wholesome support"
/>
```

> **Note** When an HTML element gets too long for one line in your text editor,
> it's appropriate to separate out each attribute on its own line as we've done
> above. This helps make your HTML code more readable.

### The Image Title Attribute

One additional attribute that can be useful is the `title`. Content added to
this attribute will display when we hover over the image with our mouse. If we
were creating an `img` tag with `src`, `alt` and `title` for a company logo, it
might look something like this:

```html
<img
  src="../images/my_company_logo.png"
  alt="my company name"
  title="We're here to help you!"
/>
```

When a visitor to your company site hovers over the logo, they'll see a message
appear saying 'We're here to help you!'

The `title` attribute isn't necessary and is often left out, but can be a nice
detail to include.

## Create Images

Its time to practice creating some images! For this challenge, feel free to use
any images you'd like - the tests are looking for the correct tag and
attributes, not the content. If you're not sure what to use, feel free to use
the following URL as your source:

```txt
https://s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard-learn/lion.jpg
```

![lion](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard-learn/lion.jpg)

Your challenge is to write _three_ image tags:

- The first should have _just_ a _source_ attribute
- The second should include an alt text, in addition to a source
- The third should have both an alt and source attribute, as well as a _title_
  attribute

Run `npm test` and read the tests as you go.

## Saving Your Work Remotely

Currently, the work you've done on this assignment is only on your local
machine. To preserve work on your GitHub fork, you will need to stage the
changes you've made, commit them, and push the commit up to GitHub. Use the
following commands to do this:

```console
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Completed assignment"
$ git push
```

If you visit your fork on GitHub, you should now see that _you've_ made the most
recent commit, and your solution will be present in the files.

## Conclusion

With images, we can fill our web pages with visual content in addition to text.
Brand logos, animated instructional guides, personal artwork and photography, or
pictures of you and your friends - you now have the ability to create visually
appealing content of _any type!_
